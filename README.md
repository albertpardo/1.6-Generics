## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This is the sixth task for **Sprint 1 Java Language** in the **Backend Java Course** in ITAcademy (Barcelona, Spain).
There are 3 levels with exercises.

### Level 1

#### Exercise 1

Create a class named **NoGenericMethods** that stores three arguments of the same type, along with methods to store and extract these objects, and a constructor to initialize the three. Ensure that the arguments can be placed in any position in the constructor call.

#### Exercise 2

Create a class named **Person** with the attributes **name**, **surname**, and **age**. Then, create a class named **GenericMethods** with a generic method that accepts three arguments of a generic type. This method should only print the arguments it has received to the screen. In the main() of the main class, call the generic method with different types of parameters.

**Example**: an object of the **Person** class, a **String**, and a primitive type.

This way, you have verified that any type of parameter can be passed in any order.

### Level 2

#### Exercise 1

#### Exercise 2

Modify the previous section so that the arguments of the generic method are a list of arguments of indefinite variables.
